Yummy Pizzas System - membership classes

The goal of this system is to create a user membership. The membership, customer, and address classes are instantiated as part of 
this process.

This repo contains the following:
- Java source code for the project
- SQL script to initialise the database


INSTRUCTIONS:
- open mySQL and create the membershipDB schema. Use the included .SQL file to create the required tables
- run the source code, executable, or JAR. All 3 will have the same effect.
- navigate to the membership tab and use the Create Membership or Manage Membership buttons. 
- in Manage Memberships you can search by name or member number. The field is case sensitive and must match the DB exactly.



Enjoy!
- Oliver
